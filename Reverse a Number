Problem statement
You are given a number 'n'.
Return an integer that is the reverse of ‘n’.
Note:
Reverse of ‘n’ means an integer where, the most significant digit of ‘n’ is the least significant digit of the number, the second most significant digit of ‘n’ is the second least significant digit of the number and so on.
Example:
Input: 'n' = 123
Output: 321
Explanation:
Reverse of 'n' = 123 is 321.


public class Solution {
    public static int reverseNumber(int n) {
        // Write your code here
        int i,newn=0;
        while(n>0)
        {
            newn=newn*10+n%10;
            n=n/10;
        }
        return newn;
    }
}
