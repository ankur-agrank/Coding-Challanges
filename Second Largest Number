Problem statement
You have been given an array ‘a’ of ‘n’ unique non-negative integers.
Find the second largest and second smallest element from the array.
Return the two elements (second largest and second smallest) as another array of size 2
Example :
Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘a’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [4, 2]
The second largest element after 5 is 4, and the second smallest element after 1 is 2.


import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public static int[] getSecondOrderElements(int n, int []a) {
        // Write your code here.
        Arrays.sort(a);
        int ar[]=new int[2];
        ar[0]=a[n-2];
        ar[1]=a[1];
        return ar;
    }
}
