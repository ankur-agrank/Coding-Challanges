There are 2 choices in the menu:
Choice 1 is to find the area of a circle having radius 'r'.
Choice 2 is to find the area of a rectangle having dimensions 'l' and 'b'.
You are given the choice 'ch' and an array 'a'.
If ‘ch’ is 1, ‘a’ contains a single number ‘r’. If ‘ch’ is 2, ‘a’ contains 2 numbers, ‘l’ and ‘b’.
Consider the choice and print the appropriate area.


public class Solution {
    public static double areaSwitchCase(int ch, double []a) {
        // Write your code here;
          switch (ch) {
            case 1: 
                double r = a[0]; 
                return Math.PI * r * r; 

            case 2: 
                double l = a[0]; 
                double b = a[1]; 
                return l * b; 

            default:
                return 0.0; 
        }
    }
}
